## Summary
In this project, we analyze a variety of college football related data in an effort to build a model that can predict on-field success. By considering both talent accumulation and recent on-field results, we aim for a model to predict relevant results for sports betting.
## Background
Recent legislation has completely changed the landscape of college sports, a multi-billion dollar business with deep roots in American sports culture. With the recent legalization of sports betting in many states and the SCOTUS O’Bannon ruling that allows athletes to be paid through so-called “Name-Image-Likeness (NIL)” deals, evaluating talent and projecting results in college sports, especially for the purpose of sports betting, is an increasingly interesting problem. We are interested in building a model to project on-field results in college football using a variety of features including an assessment of the talent level of teams as well as recent performance statistics. Our data will be scraped from various sources including the College Football Database, 247 Sports, On3, and ESPN.
## Stakeholders
- University athletic departments (for allocating NIL funds)
- College coaching staffs (for assembling rosters)
- Professional and amateur sports gamblers
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Feature selection - identify key features that determine on-field outcomes
- Predict season win totals accurately - compare to baseline model of 6 win regular season (50/50 chance of winning each game)
- Highly explainable model that allows for actionable insights
