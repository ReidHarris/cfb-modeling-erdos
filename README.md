## Predicting college sports success analyzing talent accumulation and on-field success
#### Repo Name: cfb-modeling-erdos
An Erdos Institute project by Reggie Bain, Reid Harris, and Tung Nguyen. Analyzing college football using measures of talent and on-field success. Predicting results for sports betting.
#### Summary
In this project, we analyze a variety of college football related data in an effort to build a model that can predict on-field success. 
#### Background
With the legalization of sports betting in many states and the ability of universities to pay college players through Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) programs [2, 3], predicting the results (win totals, score over/unders, point spreads, etc.) of college sporting events is an ever expanding business with a constantly changing set of variables.
